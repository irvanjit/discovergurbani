Discover Gurbani is a search engine for the Scriptures of the Sikhs, the Siree Guru Granth Sahib Jee. Sikhs regard Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji as the living embodiment of their Gurus, who laid out a path for Sikhs through their writings and life teachings. The  

The Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is the collective writings of the Gurus along with several enlightened Saints of different faiths and backgrounds. 

These writings, known as Gurbani (pronounced gurbaanee), are central to the Sikh faith as they embody the teachings of the Gurus and were compiled and sealed by the Guru themselves. Gurbani is unique in that all of it is written in poetry, and assigned various rhythms and musical measures as it is meant to be sung.

With the Guru's blessings, this app aims to allow anyone, regardless of their background or belief, to discover and experience the Guru's wisdom. The user can read Gurbani in their native tongue through various transliterations and attempt to understand what they've read through translations of the same language.

*No translation of Gurbani can ever be considered complete, and as with any translation attempt of a poem, the poetry is lost. Therefore, anyone wishing to understand Gurbani should aim to learn the Gurmukhi script. However, languages and scripts can often become barriers and this is an attempt to create a makeshift bridge.
