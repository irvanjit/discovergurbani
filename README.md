Discover Gurbani
================

Experience the Sikh Scriptures in your native language.

About
=====

Discover Gurbani is a mobile search engine for the Sikh Scriptures (called Gurbani), Guru Granth Sahib Ji. They contain the writings of the Sikh Gurus as well as other enlightened saints of different faiths. The Gurus gave these writings the highest status in the Sikh faith as they living embodiment of divinity itself. Morever, the writings are targetted towards people of all faiths to take wisdom from, Sikhs and non-Sikhs alike. However, language can often become a barrier when studying foreign texts: both for academic research and leisure/curiousity.

This app aims to allow anyone, regardless of their background or belief to discover and experience the Sikh ethos. The user can read the text in their native language’s script through transliterations, listen to the recitation, and understand what they’re read with translations of the same language.

***NOTE: No translation of the Gurbani can ever be considered complete as we are flawed by interpretation constrained by the limitations of scripts and languages. Furthermore, the poetry of the text is also lost. Therefore, anyone wishing to fully understand Gurbani should aim to learn the Gurmukhi script and correct enunciation.


Features
========

- Search for particular verses (Tukhs) and their corresponding hymns (Shabads)

*The scriptures have a brilliant but subtle indexing system: For every sentence in the text, take the first 'letter' of each 'word' and concatenate it into a query-string and index the sentences in a db with this query stirng. Developers discovered that due to the uniqueness of the query-strings, running a search against these strings with exact-matching would reduce a total result set of 95000+ data entries to just a handleful (2-5 results) with only a 3-4 character match required. This app makes use of an API that uses this system for rapid search of hymns.

- Read the scriptures at your own pace (Sehaj Paath).

- Take a Hukamnama (random reading of the scriptures)

- Discover the Raags (musical measures) of Gurbani.

*Gurbani is indexed by Raag, an Indian classical musical concept somewhat similar to musical scales. Each hymn has an associated Raag that evokes a unique mood and emotion tied to the meaning of the hymn.

Contribute
==========

There is tremendous work that is yet to be done before translation data can be made publicly available, including:
- Develop an engine to transliterate using the International Phonetic Alphabet
- Develop a web interface for volunteers to help with translations (or use one of the open-source variants)
- iOS and web versions
- Create a newer, refined RESTful API

Acknowledgements

The Discover Gurbani team is grateful to the Sikher project for the GurbaniDB platform that was used to power this app, as well as the many other Gurbani/Sikhi-based projects out there that are collectively making Gurbani widely accessible across the world.
