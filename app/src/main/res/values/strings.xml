        ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂਜੀਕਾਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ।ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂਜੀਕੀਫ਼ਤਹਿ।\n\nVaheguru Jee Ka Khalsa, Vaheguru Jee Kee Fateh!\n\nDiscover Gurbani is a search engine for the Sikh Scriptures, Siri Guru Granth Sahib Jee. They contain the writings of the Gurus as well as several other enlightened Saints of different faiths and backgrounds. Sikhs regard Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji as their eternal Guru and the living embodiment of the Gurus\’ very spirit and soul.\n\nThe writings, known as Gurbani (pronounced gurbaanee), are central to the Sikh faith as they embody the message of the Gurus and were compiled and sealed by the Guru themselves. Gurbani is unique in that all of it is poetry; the hymns are assigned rhythms and musical scales, as they are meant to be sung.\n\nWith the Guru\’s blessing, this app aims to allow anyone, regardless of their background or belief, to discover and experience the Guru\’s wisdom. The user can read Gurbani in their native tongue through various transliterations and attempt to understand what they\’ve read through translations of the same language.\n\n***No translation of Gurbani can ever be considered complete, as we are flawed by interpretation. Furthermore, as with the translation attempt of any poem, the poetry is lost. Therefore, anyone wishing to understand Gurbani should aim to learn the Gurmukhi script. However, languages and scripts can often become barriers and this is an attempt to ease the learning process for those new to Gurbani and Gurmukhi.    <!--<string name="about_page_text_1">-->

        When Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is read from start to finish, but at one’s own pace, it is referred to as a Sehaj Paath. Try reading!

    <string name="search_page_text">
        One of the many amazing qualities of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is that it contains a brilliant but subtle indexing system.\n\nOne can search the Gurbani by using the first *letter* of each *word* in a *sentence*. In this manner, it often only takes 2-4 characters to narrow a search across 5894 hymns down to about a dozen or less. Give it a try!

        For a Sikh, Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is not just a manuscript, but the very living embodiment of the Gurus spirit and soul. The wisdom and truth contained in Gurbani is a Sikhs first and foremost guide in life.\n\nOften a Sikh will seek the wisdom of the Guru regarding a personal matter. The process for doing so is called a Taking Hukamnama, wherein, after a small prayer, one will read from Guru Granth Sahib Ji from an arbitrary, random starting point. However, there is nothing arbitrary about the resulting hymn. A Sikh does not just speak to their Guru, the Guru speaks to the Sikh.
