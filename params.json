{"name":"Discover Gurbani","tagline":"Experience the Sikh Scriptures, in your native language","body":"# ਗੁਰਬਾਣੀ ਇਸੁ ਜਗ ਮਹਿ ਚਾਨਣੁ ਕਰਮਿ ਵਸੈ ਮਨਿ ਆਏ ॥੧॥\r\n\r\n#### Gurbani is the light to illuminate this world; By the grace of the King of Kings, it comes to abide within the mind. ||1|| - M3\r\n\r\n## About\r\nDiscover Gurbani is a search engine for the Sikh Scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib Ji. They contain the writings of the Sikh Gurus, as well as other enlightened Saints of different faiths and backgrounds. The Gurus gave these writings the greatest status in Sikhi and Sikhs now regard Guru Granth Sahib Ji as the eternal, living Guru - the words aren’t just words but are the living embodiment of the Guru’s very spirit and soul.\r\n\r\nThe writings, collectively referred to as Gurbani, contain the Gurus wisdom and were compiled and sealed by the Guru themselves. Gurbani is very unique among the various scriptures of the world. It isn’t just a description of the path to enlightenment, but it is the path in itself. One example is everything is written in poetic measure and assigned various musical scales and rhythms - it is not just meant to be read, but sung.\r\n\r\nWith the Guru’s blessing, this app aims to allow anyone, regardless of their background or belief, to discover and experience the Guru’s wisdom. The user can read Gurbani in their native language’s script through transliterations, listen to the recitation, and understand what they’re read with translations of the same language.\r\n\r\n***No translation of Gurbani can ever be complete as we are flawed by interpretation, and oftentimes limited by the constraints of scripts, alphabets and languages. With translations, poetic measure is usually also lost. Therefore, anyone wishing to understand Gurbani should aim to eventually learn the Gurmukhi script and correct pronunciation. However, languages can sometimes become barriers; this is an attempt to ease the learning process for those new to Gurbani.\r\n\r\n***Dhan Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj is Jagat Guru, meaning they are accessible to everyone, not just Punjabi-speaking Sikhs; people of all walks of life can take the wisdom in these shabads and apply it to their lives. Guru Sahib tells us themselves: Gurbani is the light for the entire world to behold. In our history, great Gursukhs like Baba Deep Singh Ji used to have translations of Maharaj’s saroop prepared and sent to different parts of the world, for the masses to be able to receive the Guru’s wisdom. However today, Gurbani isn’t very accessible to much of the world’s population that isn’t fluent in Punjabi or English. We should strive to learn Gurmukhi and shud uchaaran of Gurbani to fully experience the Gurshabad, but language shouldn’t be a barrier for anyone to discover the beauty of the Guru's wisdom.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Read Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji in your own language and script. \r\n\r\n- Choose from 22 transliterations and 52 translations (not will be immediately available).\r\n\r\n- Play an audio recording to guide your pronunciation and become immersed in the hymns.\r\n\r\n- Search for particular Tukhs (verses) and their corresponding Shabads (hymns):\r\n\r\n*One of the many amazing qualities of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is that they contain a brilliant but subtle indexing system. A hymn can be found by using the first 'letter' of each 'word' in the hymn. In this manner, it often only takes 2-4 characters to narrow a search across 5894 hymns down to about a dozen or less.\r\n\r\n- Discover the beauty of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji by taking a Hukamnama:\r\n\r\n*This is a means for one to communicate with Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, to ask the Guru questions and receive guidance.\r\n\r\n- Explore the Raags (musical measures) of Siri Guru Granth Sahib Ji (COMING SOON)\r\n\r\n*Gurbani is indexed by Raag, and each Raag evokes different feelings and emotions associated with it, just as various genres of music evoke various feelings in the listener.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nThe Discover Gurbani team is grateful to the Sikher project, whose GurbaniDB platform was used to power this app, as well as the many other Gurbani/Sikhi-based projects out there that have collectively the Gurus' teachings widely accessible.\r\n","google":"UA-31769059-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
